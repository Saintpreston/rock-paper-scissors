# rockPaperScissors
I had an assignment to make a digital version of a divination tool. After going through common non religious examples of divination I decided I'll make this. 


I wanted to be explorative with the pink styling. As of right now it's unfortunatly not responsive but i'll get to it when I'm done working on other personal projects. When the buttons turn red, I used async & a promise to disable user input, otherwise you can just spam clicks and break it. i also used this to cycle through the rock paper scissors by slowing down the speed at which the for loop runs.
